"""Graph/thread gateway abstractions.

The gateway package is the migration seam between UI surfaces and graph
execution. CLI, TUI, channels, and future frontends should depend on this
package for thread/run operations instead of reaching directly into
``sessions.py``, ``stream.events``, or the LangGraph SDK.
